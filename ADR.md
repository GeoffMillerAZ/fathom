# Architecture Decision Records — fathom

Fathom is a code-intelligence + evidence engine: it ingests source across one or
many repos, extracts symbols/edges/facts, stores them as **evidence
observations**, and answers concern-scoped queries (for AI coding assistants,
cross-repo blast-radius, investigations, fleet health). It exposes a Go client,
a CLI, and an MCP server.

This file records the decisions that shape the implementation, each with the
"why" rooted in a design lesson or constraint. Status: `accepted` unless noted.

---

## ADR-001 — Three-layer architecture

**Decision.** Strictly separate three layers:

1. **Connector SPI** — abstract source (`Discover`/`Fetch`); produces `SourceRef`s.
2. **Source Fusion Pipeline** — `SourceRef → bytes → extractors → Observation` records in the store; hash-gating, parallel extraction, lazy mode.
3. **Knowledge Query Layer** — `store → typed results` per query/tool; concern-scoped filtering, staleness assessment, optional hybrid semantic search.

**Why.** Each layer is independently testable and replaceable. The query layer
never touches a network; the pipeline never knows where bytes came from.

## ADR-002 — Connector SPI with a deterministic Faux connector

**Decision.** `Connector{ Discover(ctx, ServiceRef) ([]SourceRef, error); Fetch(ctx, SourceRef) ([]byte, error) }` with three impls: `LocalConnector` (disk, no network), `GitHubConnector` (gh CLI), `FauxConnector` (wraps `testdata/fauxtown/`).

**Why.** Tying ingest to a live VCS API created dev friction and non-deterministic
tests. With Faux, the entire fusion + query stack is tested against fixed fixture
data — no network, no credentials, golden-file stable. **Faux is the backbone of
the TDD strategy.**

## ADR-003 — Storage: DuckDB (supersedes the original SQLite choice)

**Decision.** Persist observations and derived tables in **DuckDB** (`github.com/marcboeker/go-duckdb/v2`).

**Context / change.** The original design used `modernc.org/sqlite` (pure-Go,
CGO-free) specifically because the project had a no-CGO constraint. **That
constraint has been lifted.** DuckDB is a columnar analytical engine that fits
fathom's workload far better: large `observations` scans, group-bys for
hotspots/metrics/fleet rollups, and (future) Parquet export for the analytical
substrate. CGO build cost is accepted.

**Consequences.** Tests and CI run with `CGO_ENABLED=1`. The store package hides
DuckDB behind an interface (`Store`) so the engine is swappable and unit-testable
with an in-memory fake. Schema tables: `observations` (main evidence),
`knowledge_cards`, `cross_ref_index`, `doc_summaries`, `runbooks`; fingerprints
in a separate store (cheap to update / clear independently).

## ADR-004 — CGO-free tree-sitter via wazero/WASM; Go via native `go/parser`

**Decision.** Multi-language extraction runs tree-sitter grammars compiled to
**WASM, executed in the pure-Go `wazero` runtime** (no CGO, no Docker, golden
testable). **Go** uses the stdlib `go/parser`/`go/ast` directly (fastest, most
complete). HCL, k8s YAML, and CUE use their native Go parsers.

**Why.** Even with CGO available for DuckDB, the WASM tree-sitter path keeps the
extractor layer deterministic and free of native grammar build chains. Go AST is
strictly better than tree-sitter for Go, so we don't pay WASM cost there.

## ADR-005 — Hash-gated, deterministic 3-pass fusion pipeline

**Decision.** Pipeline runs: **Pass 1 Filter** (sequential, ignore vendor/
testdata/generated), **Pass 2 Fetch** (N parallel workers into pre-allocated
slots, first error via atomic CAS, no mid-flight cancel), **Pass 3 post-fetch**
(sequential, in input order: SHA-256 fingerprint → hash-gate → purge stale →
budget gate → pending). Then bucket pending by language and extract.

**Why.** Re-ingesting a 15k-file repo where 14.9k files are unchanged must be
near-free (hash compares only). Determinism (same repo → same result) requires
the post-fetch pass to re-impose input order even though fetch was parallel.
Budget gating prevents runaway cost on unexpectedly large repos.

## ADR-006 — Mandatory concern-scoped queries

**Decision.** Every query carries a `concern_id`; the engine filters observations
to that concern, then scores by keyword/semantic overlap and truncates to TopN.

**Why.** Dumping all symbols for a service into an LLM context was expensive and
noisy (~measured 77% token reduction by scoping). Forcing a concern makes callers
specific and keeps results relevant and cheap.

## ADR-007 — Evidence tiers reused from agentic-kit

**Decision.** Observations carry an **evidence tier** from agentic-kit's
`foundations/review/scoring` foundation: `verified` (code, ceiling 5),
`pre-scan` (4), `doc-claimed` (2), `sme-stated` (2), `assumed` (1). The query
engine respects ceilings when scoring — a doc claim never outranks a code fact.

**Why.** fathom is a downstream consumer of the agentic-kit platform; evidence
governance is exactly what that platform provides. We import it rather than
reinvent. See ADR-009.

## ADR-008 — Staleness is always reported

**Decision.** Every query result includes a staleness assessment (which sources,
when last ingested, whether re-ingest is recommended).

**Why.** Callers must distinguish "data is fresh" from "re-ingest before trusting
this." Silent staleness is a correctness trap for AI consumers.

## ADR-009 — Depend on agentic-kit as the platform substrate

**Decision.** fathom imports `github.com/geoffmilleraz/agentic-kit` (resolved
locally via `go.work` + a `replace` directive during co-development). Reuse:
`review/scoring` (evidence tiers), `evidence/*` (observation/contradiction
shapes), `telemetry`, `llmclient` (knowledge-card enrichment), `security`
(token redaction / DLP posture), `contracts`.

**Why.** Avoids duplicating governed-evidence primitives; keeps the two projects
coherent. Changes to agentic-kit are made there when a shared primitive needs to
evolve.

## ADR-010 — MCP server: stdio + HTTP, tool groups, profiles

**Decision.** Expose tools over MCP: `serve-mcp` (stdio JSON-RPC 2.0, zero ports,
for editor/agent clients) and `serve-http` (JSON-RPC + SSE, multi-client,
platform mode loads all stores at startup). Tools are grouped
(`coding`/`investigation`/`shared`/`platform`); clients select a profile via
`set_profile` to filter the surface. A `resultcache` memoizes expensive derived
graphs and is cleared on any ingest.

**Why.** Editors want a local stdio server with no ports; platforms want a shared
HTTP server. Tool groups keep the surface relevant to the task at hand.

**Amended by ADR-014:** `set_profile` is stdio-only; over HTTP the surface is
selected per request by the endpoint path.

## ADR-014 — Path-scoped tool surfaces on the shared HTTP daemon

**Decision.** Over HTTP, the tool surface is an **immutable per-request
selection carried in the request context**, chosen by the endpoint path:
`POST /rpc` is the full registry; `POST /rpc/{surface}` serves `companion` (a
curated coding-agent allowlist) or one of the four ADR-010 groups (group +
shared tools). A named surface filters `tools/list` **and hard-gates**
`tools/call` (including `batch` sub-calls) and hides canned prompts whose
workflows it gates. `set_profile` is rejected on every HTTP request; it remains
valid on stdio (where one client owns the process, the profile stays advisory —
list-filtering only), gaining `companion` as a value. Deliberately **not**
chosen: one `mcp.Server` instance per surface (duplicates stats/prompt/resource
state and re-creates split-brain risk with any future per-server cache), a
second daemon per use case (single-writer DuckDB), and a meta-tool gateway
(destroys per-tool schemas, permissions, and ToolSearch discovery).

**Why.** The daemon is shared by many concurrent sessions, so the ADR-010
profile — a process-global mutable — let any client flip every other client's
`tools/list`, and `listChanged:false` meant nobody re-fetched; meanwhile
`tools/call` ignored the profile entirely, so "hidden" tools were still
callable. Per-request scoping fixes both without forking the registry. Scoped
endpoints also give schema-loading MCP clients a hard-bounded, ~80%-smaller
surface, while schema-deferring clients (Claude Code) stay on `/rpc` where
deferral already makes the full registry cheap. The `serve-http --call-log`
JSONL (per-call tool/surface/latency, `via:"batch"` for sub-calls) makes
surface curation measurable instead of argued.

**Trade-off / reversibility.** Surface membership is a contract (pinned by
tests and `docs/mcp-tools.md`); the `companion` allowlist is a second place a
new hot-loop tool must be added. Purely additive over ADR-010 — removing the
scoped endpoints restores the prior behavior, except `set_profile`-over-HTTP,
which was judged a defect, not a feature.

## ADR-011 — Generalized / org-agnostic, open-source-ready

**Decision.** No organization-specific names, hosts, catalogs, or product
references anywhere in code, docs, tests, or fixtures. Anything org-specific is
configuration. The `testdata/fauxtown/` fixtures use invented, neutral names.

**Why.** The project is intended to be open-sourced and adopted by any org.

## ADR-012 — Test-driven development with golden fixtures

**Decision.** Build TDD: write the failing test (often against `FauxConnector` /
`testdata/fauxtown/`) before the implementation; extractor and query outputs are
asserted with golden files; determinism is an explicit, tested property.

**Why.** A code-intelligence engine is only trustworthy if its outputs are exact
and reproducible. Tests encode that contract.

## ADR-013 — Tree-sitter via CGO bindings, superseding ADR-004's wazero mechanism

**Decision.** General-language extraction (Python, JS/TS, Rust, C, C++, C#, Java,
Ruby, Kotlin, Scala, PHP, Swift, Lua, Bash, …) runs **tree-sitter via the official
CGO Go bindings** (`github.com/tree-sitter/go-tree-sitter` + per-grammar modules
like `tree-sitter-python`), not WASM/wazero. This supersedes the *mechanism* in
ADR-004 while keeping its intent. Go still uses `go/parser`; the Track A config/IaC
formats still use their native pure-Go parsers (HCL, yaml, proto, gqlparser, CUE,
goldmark, go-toml).

**Why.** ADR-004 chose wazero to avoid a native grammar build chain, but in
practice (a) there is no production-grade pure-Go tree-sitter-via-wazero runtime —
grammar `.wasm` blobs target the Emscripten/web-tree-sitter ABI, not bare wazero;
(b) the binary **already requires CGO** for DuckDB (ADR-003), so "CGO-free" is not a
real property of the build; and (c) the CGO grammar modules vendor their C source
and compile automatically under `go build` — there is no separate emscripten/Docker
step, so ADR-004's "free of native grammar build chains" goal is actually met, and
parsing stays deterministic and golden-testable. The cost is slower CGO builds and a
C toolchain at build time, both of which the DuckDB dependency already imposes. The
WASM path remains a viable future option if a pure-Go runtime matures.

**Trade-off / reversibility.** This adds one CGO-compiled dependency per language.
It was implemented incrementally (one language per commit) so any subset can be
reverted without affecting Track A or the Go extractor.

## ADR-015 — Rename to fathom; two strata: deterministic index + semantic layers

**Decision.** The project is renamed **fathom**. Its knowledge model is explicitly
two strata: the **deterministic index** (scraped: symbols, call edges, specs,
routes — cheap, incremental, provable) and **semantic layers** (reasoned:
LLM-compiled governed claims — purpose, obligations, precedent — with citations,
tiers, and staleness). The old name survives only in historical records
(CHANGELOG entries, USAGE_JOURNAL.md, dogfood-observations.md) and in field
back-compat (`.sextantignore` fallback, legacy telemetry prefixes, service-name
aliasing in session-hook and reingest tooling; see `docs/rename-migration.md`).

**Why.** A sextant navigates by surface sightings; a fathom measures depth. The
product's differentiation is no longer only navigation (where is the symbol) but
governed depth (what governs this file, why, and how sure are we). The rename
landed with the semantic-layers founding design so the brand and the architecture
say the same thing.

**Trade-off / reversibility.** One-time operator migration (daemon label, MCP
registration, fleet re-ingest); GitHub redirects the old repo URL. Back-compat
shims are removable once the fleet has migrated.

## ADR-016 — Semantic layers: governed claims beside the index, tracer-bullet first

**Decision.** Semantic layers are **LLM-compiled, governed claims** stored in
additive tables beside observations (`semantic_claims`, `claim_links`,
`compile_runs`, minimal `claim_events`) — never inside `observations` (re-ingest
purges destructively; contradiction scan is kind-blind). Claim identity is
content-addressed (layer, kind, subject, aiprovenance `repro_key`); superseded
claims are status-flipped, never deleted. V1 claims carry the existing
`doc-claimed` tier (citation-grounded doc restatements); a distinct `ai-derived`
tier waits for the first non-citable claim kind. Freshness is dual: a token-free
post-ingest citation sweep AND a query-time status check — stale claims are
served flagged, never silently. Compilation is incremental (per-section input
digests), DLP-gated, budget-gated (dry-run estimate mandatory; real usage
ledgered), and verified at compile time (claims with unresolvable citations or
scopes are rejected). The first layer is a **tracer bullet** — `obligations`
(governing docs → per-file rules, served ≤150 tokens on the companion surface,
zero-output-on-clean) — gated by eval fixtures (precision ≥0.90 with scope
traps) and a 3-week generalize-or-kill telemetry gate. The generic layer
runtime, lifecycle FSM/ledger, graph ontology, vectors, and new tiers are
deferred with named revival evidence. Full design: `docs/design/semantic-layers.md`.

**Why.** Judged synthesis of four competing architectures under three lenses.
The external record: deterministic spine first (embeddings-first engines got
retracted); freshness is the product-killer nobody solved for LLM artifacts;
coverage-first ontologies die before delivering; knowledge without a consuming
tool stalls; costs must scale with change size, not repo size. Fathom's edge is
governance — provenance, contradiction, staleness, costed compilation,
telemetry-gated existence — which no surveyed system exposes.

**Expert-module commitments (locked now so the north star needs no restart):**
corpus-agnostic core (open ref strings, never code-only types); the store is the
module (self-describing: claims, ledger, evals, watermarks travel inside it);
vectors are an additive in-store column (DuckDB VSS) when earned, never a second
store; determinism + tiers are the product; federation composes above the engine
(one module = one store), never inside it.

**Trade-off / reversibility.** If the tracer bullet fails its gate, the sunk cost
is three small tables and one compiler pass. Claim tables are additive; the
schema's stable IDs and repro keys make every deferred piece (ledger, tiers,
runtime) a non-destructive retrofit.

## ADR-017 — Born-portable stores: repo-relative anchors, domain-neutral freshness

**Context.** D-EM2 ("the store is the module") was prose, not code: the local
connector recorded absolute machine-local paths as observation anchors, so a
store could not leave its build machine with citations intact — and freshness
assumed git, so non-git corpora (docs folders, findings exports — the expert-
module shape) could never say whether they were stale. Both are cheap at schema
time and migrations forever after, so the tax is paid **before** the ADR-016
claims DDL lands.

**Decision.**
1. **Repo-relative anchors.** Every connector emits slash-separated,
   root-relative `SourceRef.Path`s; `LocalConnector.Fetch` resolves them
   against the root recorded at Discover (absolute refs from legacy stores are
   still read as-is). The store never records a machine-local absolute path.
2. **Root remap.** Moving a corpus (or shipping a store) is one metadata
   update: `fathom remap --store … --service … --path …` rewrites
   `service_meta.path`; queries, source fetching, watermarks, and re-ingest
   resolve through it immediately.
3. **Watermark SPI.** `Connector.Watermark(ctx, svc)` returns an opaque
   freshness token: bare git HEAD SHA when available, else a content-addressed
   `manifest:`-prefixed hash over (relative path, content hash) pairs — stable
   across moves, changed iff content changes. The fusion pipeline records it as
   `IndexedCommit`; auto-refresh falls back to it when git HEAD is absent, so
   non-git corpora auto-refresh too.
4. **Self-heal.** An ingest that discovers relative refs against a store
   holding absolute-anchored fingerprints purges that service's content
   wholesale (observations, fingerprints, doc summaries; identity rows kept)
   and rebuilds — one-shot, reported via `Report.PurgedLegacyAnchors`. No
   operator memory required; `scripts/reingest-fleet.sh` remains the clean
   rebuild.
5. **Tier profiles (data now, machinery later).** The ADR-016 claims schema
   carries a `tier_profile` reference column from birth so tier vocabularies
   can be reinterpreted per corpus domain when a non-engineering module first
   needs it (its named revival evidence).

**Contract.** `TestStorePortability_RoundTrip` (pkg/client): build a store on
corpus A, move the corpus, remap the root — symbols answer, citations resolve,
the watermark reads fresh (not falsely drifted), re-ingest is fully hash-gated.
That test is the publishable meaning of "portable store" until the H2 format
spec exists.

**Trade-off / reversibility.** Manifest watermarks read the whole corpus (fine
for small doc corpora; git corpora use HEAD). Legacy stores keep working
read-only via the absolute-ref fallback; the first write-path ingest converts
them. Reverting to absolute anchors would only require connectors to stop
relativizing — nothing downstream depends on absoluteness anymore.
